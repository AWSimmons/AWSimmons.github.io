            Delicious, handcooked food that doesn't cost an arm and a leg. My favourite was a big serving of closed-cap mushrooms for a fiver, that are long smoked to an almost meaty intensity and dressed with dollops of boisterous salsa verde.
            The ingredients are all certified farm-grown - no vat cultured biomass! Use NBN's City Life guide to find your nearest branch.
